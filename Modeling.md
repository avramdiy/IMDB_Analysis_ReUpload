# Commit 5 - Code Update and Model Deletion for GitHub Push

### Summary:
In this commit, I made several key changes to the project, including the deletion of the `train_model` file to ensure the code was able to be pushed to GitHub. While the model file was necessary for training, it was too large to upload to GitHub. I resolved this by removing it, ensuring that the code continues to work as expected. The model can be retrained or replaced as necessary.

### Changes:
1. **Deleted `train_model.py`**:
   - The file was removed to comply with GitHubâ€™s file size limitations, as the model was too large to upload.
   - The deletion of this file ensures the repository can be pushed successfully to GitHub.

2. **Ensured Model Functionality**:
   - Despite removing the `train_model.py` file, all the other code and functions work as expected, including data preprocessing, model prediction, and route handling.
   - The model can be retrained locally or with a smaller file size for future versions.

### Notes:
- The project is functional without the model file for now. The model can be generated again as needed.
- This change was necessary to push the repository to GitHub while keeping the project structure intact.
